Revenue Insights in Hospitality Business

Project Short Info: 

Created a report (interactive dashboard) to help the revenue team in assessing the company’s position in the industry and provide insights into how lost revenue and market share can be restored.

Project Description:

In this project, I developed a one-page interactive Power BI dashboard to deliver revenue insights for a hospitality company operating multiple properties. I created key performance indicators (KPIs) including Revenue, RevPAR, Occupancy Rate, Revenue Realised %, Average Daily Sellable Room Nights, and Average Daily Booked Room Nights, etc. I visualised performance trends with charts such as revenue by property category, a RevPAR vs Occupancy Rate trend chart, and a detailed metrics table (including property ratings). This enabled user-level filtering by City, Room Class, Month, and Week to support dynamic business decisions.

What I Learned:

•	KPI design and DAX measure creation and grouping

•	Building visually intuitive and filterable dashboards

•	Performing comparative trend analysis

•	Structuring data for storytelling and business impact
